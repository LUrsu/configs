configs
=======
These are the config files that I use for term as well as awesome as a windows manager.

Install
-------
you can run the install script to install and set up the following:
  1. awesome windows manager
  2. oh-my-zsh
  3. vim plugins

use the -l flag to link the config files to the repo so it'll automatically update configs when you pull from github

`./install.sh -l`
